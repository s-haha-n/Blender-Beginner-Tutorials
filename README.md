# Blender Basics for Beginners
_A step-by-step curriculum designed to teach younger users and absolute beginners the foundational skills in Blender._

## Overview
This curriculum focuses on introducing Blender's most essential tools and concepts in a simplified, hands-on way. Each lesson builds on the last, avoiding advanced topics like modifiers or complex rendering, at first, to ensure a smooth learning experience.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Creating a Flower (Basic Modeling with Individual Meshes)
**Objective**: Learn to create a simple flower using basic shapes and manipulations.

**Key Concepts Covered**:
- **3D ViewPort Basics**:
  - The ViewPort (or "scene") is where we see and interact with our objects.
  - Used `G` (grab), `R` (rotate), and scaling (`S`) to manipulate objects.
- **Adding and Transforming Shapes**:
  - Added UV Spheres for petals and scaled them to make them flat and narrow.
  - Positioned petals around a central bud (also a scaled UV Sphere).
  - Used a cylinder for the stem and entered **Edit Mode** to extrude and scale parts of it.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Students recreated the flower step-by-step by:
    - Adding and positioning shapes.
    - Adjusting their scale and rotation.
- **Positive Reinforcement**:
  - Encouraged by celebrating small wins ("Great job placing that petal!") and allowing creativity in colors and placement.

### Lesson 2: Creating a Flower (Using Edit Mode & UI Basics)
**Objective**: Reinforce previous skills while introducing Edit Mode and Blender’s core UI components.

**Key Concepts Covered**:
- **Blender’s UI Structure**:
  - **3D ViewPort**: Where objects are seen and edited.
  - **Outliner**: Contains everything in the scene; objects can be hidden or shown using the eyeball icon.
  - **Properties Area**: Updates based on the selected object; used for assigning materials and adjusting settings.
- **Renaming Objects and Materials**:
  - Emphasized the importance of naming objects logically in the Outliner.
  - Taught how to create materials, assign colors, and name them with purpose (e.g., "PetalColor" for the flower petals).
- **Extruding Faces**:
  - Introduced Edit Mode by extruding faces from the side of a cylinder to create petals.
  - Explained *extrude* as “pulling out new parts of an object, like stretching Play-Doh.”
- **Interactive Learning**:
  - Highlighted the fun, interactive nature of extruding faces, which generated significant enthusiasm.
  - This was by far the most interesting thing for them, noted and thinking of similar stuff...

### Lesson 3: Creating a Unicorn with edit mode and creating shapes (WIP)
**Objective**: Review previous lessons covered and quiz ((WIP

**Key Concepts to Cover**:
- **WIP**: Adding a reference image is crucial early on .... wip
  - **Edit Mode**: using E to make vertices line up with a reference image.

## Teaching Notes
- **Key Teaching Techniques**:
  - Show and repeat: Demonstrate a task, then have the student replicate it.
  - Positive reinforcement: Celebrate success and encourage creativity.
  - Chunked learning: Break complex processes (like flower modeling) into small, manageable steps.
- **Student Engagement**:
  - Excitement peaked during hands-on activities, especially during:
    - Extruding faces.
    - Interactive manipulations like grabbing, scaling, and rotating objects.

## Next Steps
1. **Future Lessons**:
   - Build on current skills by introducing simple projects like a unicorn or a house using basic modeling techniques.
   - Gradually introduce lighting, cameras, and rendering single images.
2. **Refining Concepts**:
   - Reinforce core tools (`G`, `R`, `S`, extrude) and UI understanding.
   - Introduce **grouping** and better object organization in the Outliner.
3. **Quantifying Engagement**:
   - Track activities that generate excitement (e.g., extrude) to tailor lessons.
